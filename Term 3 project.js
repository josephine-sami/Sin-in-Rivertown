It seemed frozen in time, with the murmurs of the river echoing through narrow streets lined with ancient buildings and cozy shops.","\n","^You had been sent to Rivertown following a series of mysterious incidents that had caught the attention of authorities. Reports indicated unexplained illnesses linked to local businesses, strange happenings at the town's church, and rumors of illegal activities involving rare plants.","\n","^Upon checking into the charming local hotel that would be your temporary residence, your mind buzzed with questions. Who were the key figures in this town? What secrets did they hold? Was there a connection between these seemingly unrelated incidents, or was Rivertown merely concealing darker truths beneath its tranquil facade?","\n","^Determined to uncover the mysteries shrouding Rivertown, you began meeting its residents. From Nathan, the friendly baker seemingly oblivious to rumors surrounding his bread, to Lillian, the flower shop owner suspected of illegally trading in protected flora, each encounter deepened the intrigue.","\n","^At Abner's modest home, where he conducted private tutoring sessions, you sensed an aura of secrecy. His influence over the town's youth seemed significant yet clouded by troubling whispers of radical ideologies infiltrating his teachings.","\n","^Lastly, Tim, the church's steadfast priest, projected an air of tranquility that belied unsettling rumors. Allegations of breached confessions surrounded him, yet he maintained an aura of quiet dedication, seemingly unaware of the murmurs following him.","\n","^As you delved deeper into Rivertown's undercurrents, you realized that beneath its idyllic exterior lay a complex web of relationships and secrets. Each resident held a piece of the puzzle, and it was your mission to uncover the truth before the town's facade shattered, revealing the darkness lurking within.","\n","^Thus, your journey into Rivertown beganâ€”an investigation that would test your resolve, challenge your perceptions, and unearth truths that some would prefer remain buried forever.","\n",{"->":"start"},["done",{"#f":5,"#n":"g-0"}],null],"done",{"start":[["^Where do you want to visit?
